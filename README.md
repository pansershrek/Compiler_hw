"Parser.c" is a program which calculates math expression by recursive descent method.
"Ast." is a program which creates AST from math expression and calculates it from the tree.

To run parser you should do next:

```bash
$ make parser
$ ./proj_parser
```

To run ast you should do next:

```bash
$ make ast
$ ./proj_ast
```

If you want to write AST to file "OUTPUT" you should do next:

```bash
$ make ast
$ ./proj_ast OUTPUT
```
